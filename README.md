# Bitcoin Price Prediction

## Context

The objective of this project is to predict the Bitcoin's price based on its last prices, and the result from the sentiment analysis of Tweets related to bitcoin and crypto currencies, through a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the graphs from Plotly. To fully visualize the Bitcoin_Price_Predictor notebook please open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OEfmmx4HKYJ4jbFQ-M5uHPcDqNW0b6kv?usp=sharing).
